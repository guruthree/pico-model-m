## Pico Model M Keyboard

This project contains code to scan the matrix of an IBM 122-key Model M keyboard ("Battleship"), identify key presses, and then act as a standard USB HID keyboard.

This code was written with a 1394324 terminal keyboard in mind, but should be easily modified for any keyboard matrix by editing keyboardlayout.h. I wrote this code as I found the QMK/TMK/etc projects a bit confusing and I wasn't quite convinced it would offer the fleixiblity I wanted. Particularly, I found most projects operating in a 'converter' mode relied on atmega32u4 chips. I've not had great luck with these when trying to make a converter previously, you're still limited by the original keyboard controller, and they use the full AVR programming environment (including programing directly with avrdude), which I'm not fond of. I found indications QMK could operate on a keyboard matrix, but that left an additional challenge.

The big immediate challenge of working directly with an 122-key membrane is that it has 8 columns and 20 rows, and thus needs a microcontroller with 28 GPIO pins. This rules the 32u4 out. The RP2040 however, has 36 GPIO pins. The [Pimoroni PGA2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pga2040) exposes 30 of these GPIO pins, and at quite an affordable price (Â£5.50 on sale). The lack of a USB header on the PGA2040 is also a plus, as that makes it easy to modify the original keyboard cable to act as a USB cable.
